## Story

Dummy is very lonely and a great friend. So he made sure that if someone logs into his computer, (s)he would never be able to get out. So, are you going to stay with him or try to break out with your `bash` skills?  

Dummy is heavily inspired from the [Mad Dummy from Undertale](https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Mad_Dummy).
