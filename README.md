# Bash the Dummy!

This is a basic javascript game for the BLM0226 Web TabanlÄ± Programlama class.

## Story

Dummy is a very lonely and great friend. So he made sure that if someone logs into his computer, (s)he would never be able to get out. So, are you going to stay with him or try to break out?  

Dummy is heavily inspired from the [Mad Dummy from Undertale](https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Mad_Dummy).
