## Story

Dummy is very lonely and a great friend. So he made sure that if someone logs into his computer, (s)he would never be able to get out. So, are you going to stay with him or try to break out with your `bash` skills?  

Dummy is heavily inspired from the [Mad Dummy](https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Mad_Dummy) from [Undertale](https://undertale.com/). But now, he is friendly and still a bit mad too!

## How to play?

There is a freely hosted web server that you can directly play: [Bash the Dummy!](http://bashthedummy.coolpage.biz/)  

But if you want to play it locally:

1. Download this repository
2. Open a http server in that location (if you have `python` installed, you can type: `python -m http.server`)
3. And go to `localhost:[PORT]` at your browser

## Known bugs, available commands and walkthrough

Terminal is `bash` based but still some of the `bash`'s functions may not work.  
Also if you don't know bash check [this](available_commands.md) for commands.  
If you couldn't beat the game, you can check [walkthrough](walkthrough.md).
